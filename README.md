# hadoop-assignment

In this assignment, I learnt to use the hadoop-client map and reduce functions from the Mapper and Reducer classes. I also learnt how to use Maven to manage my projects dependancies as well as generating the .jar file that I used to run the map reduce algorithm on the VM.

+ To execute the .jar file 
<code><pre>yarn jar <my_jar.jar> input output</pre></code>

+ To see the result of the map reduce
<code><pre>hdfs dfs -cat output/part-r-00000</pre></code>
